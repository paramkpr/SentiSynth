\begin{abstract}
  Sentiment analysis systems often struggle when applied to new
  domains or nuanced language phenomena like sarcasm. Labeled data
  for each new domain is costly to obtain, as exemplified by the
  $\sim$67{,}000 annotated examples in the popular SST-2 benchmark
  (with roughly 90\% for training and 5\% each for validation and
  testing)~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. We propose \textbf{SentiSynth}, a
  framework that addresses data scarcity by combining large-scale
  synthetic text generation with knowledge distillation in a
  closed-loop teacher--student architecture. A powerful teacher model
  first verifies and filters synthetic examples produced by a
  generative model, ensuring quality control via a confidence
  threshold. The teacher's rich probabilistic outputs are then used
  as soft labels to train a student sentiment classifier, augmented
  by a weighting scheme to balance synthetic and real data. On the
  SST-2 dataset, SentiSynth achieves a 5 percentage point F$_1$ score
  improvement while using only 10\% of the human-labeled data,
  demonstrating a practical reduction in annotation
  requirements~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. We release our code and
  synthetic data generation pipeline to facilitate further research.

\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Motivation and Problem Definition}
Sentiment analysis is integral to many real-world applications such
as brand monitoring, customer feedback analysis, and crisis response
on social media~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. Organizations seek to
automatically gauge public sentiment about products or events in real
time, which can inform marketing strategies or immediate
interventions. However, building high-quality sentiment classifiers
for specific domains or emerging topics requires substantial labeled
data. For example, the Stanford Sentiment Treebank (SST-2) contains
roughly 67,000 annotated text snippets, which were expensive and
time-consuming to collect~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. Typically, about 90\% of
such data is used for model training, with only 5\% reserved for
validation and 5\% for testing. In specialized domains (e.g.,
financial news, medical forums) or low-resource languages,
obtaining tens of thousands of labeled examples is often impractical.

Pre-trained Transformer models have revolutionized sentiment analysis
by enabling fine-tuning on relatively small datasets. Despite their
success, these models still face significant limitations under domain
shift and when encountering linguistic nuances. A sentiment
classifier trained on movie reviews, for instance, may falter when
applied to social media posts or product reviews that differ in tone
and vocabulary~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. Moreover, Transformers can
misinterpret sarcasm or idiomatic expressions---e.g., the phrase "Well,
that's just great" might be labeled positive by a literal model
despite its negative sarcastic intent~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. These
challenges highlight the need for methods that can adapt sentiment
models to new domains and capture subtle cues without relying on
prohibitively large labeled datasets.

\subsection{Research Gap}
Prior research has explored two general strategies to tackle data
scarcity in sentiment analysis: synthetic data generation and
knowledge distillation. However, these strategies have largely been
pursued independently, leaving a gap in how they might complement
each other. On one hand, synthetic text generation techniques (such
as back-translation or language model prompting) can produce
additional training examples to expand a small dataset
\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. On the other hand, knowledge distillation uses a
high-capacity teacher model to guide a student model, often assuming
a fully labeled training set or using unlabeled data that the teacher
labels~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. Few works have closely integrated these
approaches in a unified framework.

Notably, existing methods that do employ synthetic augmentation often
lack a feedback loop between the data generator and the classifier. A
language model might generate hundreds of examples, but without any
verification step, low-quality or label-noise instances can slip into
the training data~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. In contrast, a teacher model (a
strong classifier) could be used to vet these generated samples, yet
previous studies seldom incorporate such a mechanism during data
generation. This absence of teacher feedback means the potential
synergy between generation and model guidance is underutilized.

Another underexplored aspect in past work is the use of quality
thresholds for accepting synthetic data. While it is intuitive to
filter out generated examples on which the teacher model has low
confidence (to avoid training on dubious data), the choice of
confidence threshold $\tau$ is typically ad-hoc or not explicitly
discussed in literature~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. If $\tau$ is set too low,
the training set may be polluted with ambiguous or incorrect
examples; if set too high, many useful synthetic examples are
discarded, limiting the data boost. To date, there is little
systematic study on how to balance this trade-off in the context of
sentiment analysis. This research gap motivates an approach that
tightly couples synthetic data generation with teacher verification
and carefully chosen quality controls.

\subsection{Contributions}
Our work proposes a novel framework, \textbf{SentiSynth}, which
addresses the above gaps. The main contributions are:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Teacher-Verified Generation}: We introduce a
    closed-loop data generation process where a pre-trained generator
    (GPT-2) creates candidate text samples and a high-accuracy
    teacher classifier (DeBERTa) filters them by requiring a
    predicted sentiment confidence $\ge \tau$ ~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. This
    ensures only high-quality, label-consistent synthetic examples
    are added to the training data.
  \item \textbf{Soft-Label Caching}: Instead of using only hard
    labels, we store the teacher's full probability distribution
    (soft labels) for each accepted synthetic example, with
    temperature smoothing to retain informative uncertainty patterns
    ~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. These soft labels are cached and later used to
    train the student model, transferring richer knowledge from
    teacher to student.
  \item \textbf{Weighted Training}: We design a weighted training
    regimen where synthetic examples are down-weighted by a factor
    $\beta$ in the loss function ~\cite{CITATION_NEEDED}. This balances the
    influence of synthetic data relative to the original
    human-labeled data, mitigating potential noise from
    machine-generated texts while still benefiting from the augmented examples.
  \item \textbf{Empirical Gains}: Through extensive experiments on
    SST-2, we demonstrate that SentiSynth achieves a substantial
    improvement of approximately \textbf{+5 percentage points} in
    F$_1$ score over strong baselines, despite using only
    \textbf{10\% of the human-labeled data} for training. This result
    highlights the framework's practicality in reducing annotation costs.
  \item \textbf{Open-Source Release}: We publicly release our full
    codebase, synthetic data generation scripts, and the augmented
    datasets produced by SentiSynth. We hope this will enable
    reproducibility and inspire future research into combined
    generation–distillation methods for NLP.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Paper Roadmap}
The remainder of this paper is organized as follows. In Section~2, we
review the background and related work, including the evolution of
sentiment analysis approaches and existing techniques in data
augmentation and knowledge distillation. Section~3 details the
SentiSynth methodology, describing the teacher-verified generation
process, the caching of soft labels, and the weighted training
strategy. Section~4 then presents experimental results, comparing
SentiSynth to baselines and analyzing the impact of key
hyperparameters (e.g., $\tau$ and $\beta$). In Section~5, we discuss
ethical considerations of synthetic data generation and knowledge
distillation, such as potential bias introduction and data fidelity.
Finally, Section~6 concludes the paper and outlines future research directions.
